## About the project
Hello! This project is made with React + TypeScript on front-end side and Java Spring Boot on back-end. Its role is to implement the functionality of instagram. All made by me independently. Here a description of the most interesting options:

**Front-end (React + TypeScript):**

1.  **Photo Upload and Database Storage:** Users can upload photos, and the app stores them in the backend database. Utilizing React components and TypeScript ensures a robust and type-safe front-end.
    
2.  **Infinite Scrolling:** Implementing infinite scrolling enhances user experience. As users scroll, more content is dynamically loaded, providing a seamless browsing experience. React makes managing the UI state straightforward.
    
3.  **User Follow Feature:** Users can follow each other, fostering a sense of community. React handles the dynamic rendering of followers and facilitates smooth interactions. TypeScript adds type safety to the user-related operations.
    

**Back-end (Java Spring Boot):**

1.  **RESTful API:** Spring Boot facilitates the creation of a robust RESTful API, allowing seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. It supports CRUD operations for managing user data, photos, and more.
    
2.  **Photo Storage in Database:** Spring Boot manages storing and retrieving photos in/from the database. Leveraging Java's capabilities ensures efficient handling of data and interactions with the database.
    
3.  **User Management:** The backend handles user-related operations like authentication, authorization, and user data management. Spring Security can be employed for secure user authentication.
